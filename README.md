# FiscalDriverBase
Contract definition for Fiscal Drivers

This project defines the contract for the interface between a POS system and any fiscal driver accross the world <br>
<br>
Many of the existing drivers where programmed more than a decade ago in Visual Basic, so COM interop had to be implemented for those drivers to reference and honor this interface.
